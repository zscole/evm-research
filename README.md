#What is the EVM?
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It works by interpreting bytecode instructions, which are generated from high-level programming languages like Solidity, and executing them on a network of computers.  

Here's a simple explanation of how the EVM works:  

Compilation: Smart contracts are written in high-level programming languages, like Solidity. These contracts are compiled into bytecode, a low-level language that the EVM can understand.
  
Transaction execution: When a user wants to interact with a smart contract, they send a transaction to the Ethereum network. This transaction includes the bytecode of the smart contract and any data needed to execute it.
  
Verification: Before the transaction is executed, it is verified by other nodes in the network to ensure that it meets certain criteria, like having enough funds to pay for gas fees.
  
Execution: Once the transaction is verified, the EVM interprets the bytecode of the smart contract and executes its instructions on the network of computers running the Ethereum software.
  
State changes: As the smart contract is executed, it may modify the state of the blockchain, for example by transferring funds or updating the status of a digital asset.
  
Gas fees: Every transaction on the Ethereum network requires gas fees, which are paid in Ether and used to compensate the network nodes for executing the transaction and prevent spam or abuse.
  
Overall, the EVM is a powerful tool for building decentralized applications on the blockchain, enabling developers to write complex smart contracts that can execute autonomously and securely on a global network of computers.
